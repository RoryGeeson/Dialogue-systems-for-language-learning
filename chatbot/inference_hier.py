"""
A dialogue system meant to be used for language learning.

This is based on Google Neural Machine Tranlation model
https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt
which is based on Thang Luong's thesis on
Neural Machine Translation: https://github.com/lmthang/thesis

And on the paper Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems
Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04808.pdf

Created by Tudor Paraschivescu for the Cambridge UROP project
"Dialogue systems for language learning"

To perform inference on given a trained hierarchical model."""
